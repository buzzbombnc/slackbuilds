# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

daemontools:
daemontools: daemontools is a collection of tools for managing UNIX services.
daemontools: supervise monitors a service. It starts the service and restarts the
daemontools: service if it dies. Setting up a new service is easy: all supervise
daemontools: needs is a directory with a run script that runs the service.
daemontools: multilog saves error messages to one or more logs. It optionally
daemontools: timestamps each line and, for each log, includes or excludes lines
daemontools: matching specified patterns. It automatically rotates logs to limit
daemontools: the amount of disk space used. If the disk fills up, it pauses and
daemontools: tries again, without losing any data.
